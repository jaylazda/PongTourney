Pong Tourney
iOS app built to create and host beer pong tournaments with live game stat tracking and leaderboards to compare
yourself with friends.
*** Note: This app is not complete, it's still being developed and hasn't been released on the app store yet. ***

Getting Started
Clone the project and open in Xcode. So far only tested on iPhone 11 Pro Max.

Prerequisites
MacOS
Xcode

Setting up an account
First you must sign up in the app after which you will be directed to the home page.
Same goes for logging in.

Creating a tournament
From the home page, select "Tournament" then "Set Up Tournament".
Select number of desired players and click "Go"
To join a tournament, you need the tournament ID which will be provided by the host.
From the home page, select "Tournament" then "Join Tournament".

Tournament Games
Games can only be started once the tournament is full. Click on the row with your name on it to start your game.
Essentially, you mirror your real life shots/hits/misses by clicking the different buttons. 
Select which cups you hit and if you win you move on to the next round.

Leaderboards
Still in development, will display all your friends stats upon completion.

My Stats
Still in development, will show your stats and your most recent games.

Single Game
Still in development, will let users play a game without creating a tournament.
